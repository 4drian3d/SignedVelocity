## Why SignedVelocity if UnSignedVelocity already exists?
UnSignedVelocity is a plugin that removes the limitation in Velocity to block or modify chat or commands executed by players with versions 1.19.1 or higher and who have a valid SignedKey. Although this works most of the time, there are issues that have arisen since version 1.19.3, which, as Mojang has implemented more security checks in the chat reporting system, has driven players out of the game.

SignedVelocity solves all these problems, synchronizing the blocking and modification of chat and commands to the backend server, where it is possible to modify the chat.
