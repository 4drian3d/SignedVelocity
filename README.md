Allows you to cancel or modify messages or commands from Velocity without synchronization problems

## Requirements
- Java 21+
- Velocity 3.3.0+
#### **Backend:**
- Paper 1.19.4+ 
- Sponge 8.1/10+
- Minestom 1.20.4+
- Fabric 1.21+

## Features
- Transmit the modification and cancellation status of Velocity messages and commands to your backend server using plugin messages. This avoids chat chain synchronization problems and avoids Velocity's security check by correctly synchronizing messages.
- Chat reporting support using Velocity (can be disabled using external plugins like FreedomChat, **not recommended**)
- Ability to remove the unsecured chat warning when logging into each server. Requires [VPacketEvents](https://modrinth.com/plugin/vpacketevents) or [PacketEvents](https://modrinth.com/plugin/packetevents)

### Why SignedVelocity if UnSignedVelocity already exists?

UnSignedVelocity is a plugin that removes the limitation in Velocity to block or modify chat or commands executed by players with versions 1.19.1 or higher and who have a valid SignedKey. Although this works most of the time, there are issues that have arisen since version 1.19.3, which, as Mojang has implemented more security checks in the chat reporting system, has driven players kicked out of the proxy.

SignedVelocity solves all these problems, synchronizing the blocking and modification of chat and commands to the backend server, where it is possible to modify the chat.
